# React-projs
A  multi-purpose react-app built to showcase my basic react skills. The best part is VConnect, a working social media frontend that can be used to make posts, comments, replies and like all of those. Images can also be uploaded as a part of post. Also contains a login mechanism not based on any backend auth.Also contains minor features that are WIP
* You may only see the navbar when you click on the deployment link.. CLick on something (say Home) on tbe navbar to see the fully working frontend. Still learning to host react flawlessly on Github
