# React-projs
A  multi-purpose react-app built to showcase my basic react skills. The best part is VConnect, a working social media frontend that can be used to make posts, comments, replies and like all of those. Images can also be uploaded as a part of post. Also contains a login mechanism not based on any backend auth.Also contains minor features that are WIP
